                In the Cellar, all weapons that have ever been obtained (picked up at least once) are displayed along with their stats and the number of times obtained.
                This number is increased by obtaining that weapon from the Gashapon Machine, the Chest inside the Living Room,
                Chests found during a run, Vending Machines, or from the shop via purchase during a run. 
                For Starter Weapons, once upgraded, their Cellar frames of unupgraded versions will be permanently replaced by their upgraded ones. 
                There is also an empty frame that represents attacking with an empty hand. Seasonal weapons will not appear in the Cellar.
